# Github Username API

Create a webpage to find repositories from a given Github username. The webpage should enable the user to enter a Github username into a form and send this form to the Github API to retrieve a list of all the user's repositories.

You are going to have to research the GitHub API documentation and try out things to figure out how to do this (a major part of modern web development!). Don't be afraid of failure! Trying and failing is a great way to learn and error messages are your friend.

**Notes:**
- Use only classes and use only async/await syntax. The styling is up to you.
- Use the existing files `index.html`, `css/main.css`, `js/index.js` to create your page.

**BONUS** Show two of these forms and repository lists side by side.
